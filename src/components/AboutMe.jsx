            With a B-Tech. degree in Computer Science domain from SASTRA Deemed University, I specialize in the skills mentioned above in the skills section, and I have a keen interest in creating seamless website with greater User Experience. My journey began as a young motivated guy, with only one motive -<br /><br /><br /> <i><strong>"I never cease the journey of learning, for nothing can truly satisfy my thirst for knowledge."</strong></i><br /><br /><br /> Since then, Iâ€™ve worked on diverse projects that challenge me to push my creative boundaries. I thrive in collaborative environments where I can share ideas and learn from others.
