                <p className="hobbies-description">Art has been a journey that constantly surprises me. Each line, each stroke, becomes a small adventure into something unknown. There's something deeply satisfying about capturing a moment, a feeling, or even a thought that words sometimes canâ€™t express. Art for me is a companion, a way to communicate with myself and the world, and with each piece, I feel a little closer to understanding my own voice.</p>
